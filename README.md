Data Science Project Milestone 1 

Group: Jacob Waxman and Chloe Uhls

Project:
Together we will be analyzing homelessness in the United States. We will look on a national level to see what factors have the biggest impacts on homelessess. We will break down the country by cities and states and analyze key points including regional temperature, minimum wage, state’s political-leaning, etc. We will also look at the effects of the pandemic and how it has changed homelessess in the US.

Datasets: Include question(s) for each 

Downloaded 2007-2020 PIT Estimates by State from HUD exchange.

This data was really exciting to find. It includes the most recent homelessness(2020 status) and the change over time since 2007. The spreadsheet includes specific categories including total homelessness by state, breakdowns by gender and race, and status of homeless citizens (sheltered, unsheltered, etc). One question to analyze: which gender has a higher population of homelessness in Illinois?

Downloaded Homelessness by Race, Homelessness by Gender, National Trends by Subpopulation CSV Files.

The data sources listed on this website are particularly interesting because they give the factors that go into homelessness, which aims to help us understand how we can solve it. When looking at homelessness by race I noticed that White people had the highest amount of homeless people, but when you switch it to rate per 10,000 people, the category Pacific Islanders switches to the top. This goes back to in class when we talked about the importance of weighted averages. We can analyze how the history of the United States goes into the factors of who experiences homelessness in this country.

Downloaded Homelessness by Population CSV File.

This data is interesting because it includes different columns that describes different factors that are attributed with homelessness such as age and whether or not they are in a family. The data set lists multiple cities per state to give a better understanding of homelessness in different areas of each state. Each state has two cities as observations depending on its population density.

Collaboration Plan: 
Chloe and I will be meeting roughly twice a week to work on our project. We will meet virtually via Zoom and in person depending on the week. We will use a Github repository to collaborate and save our coding progress. We will use (are currently using) Google Docs for written reports throughout the semester, then we’ll upload it to github to make sure it’s all stored together. 
In terms of coding, we will use the same strategies that we learned in class: Python coding and data scraping and the pandas library for analysis.
